C Maze Runner

An interactive console-based maze game developed in C. This project demonstrates modular C programming principles, featuring a separation of concerns for:

- Maze Generation Logic: (e.g., in mazegen.c)
- Core Utility Functions: (e.g., in utility.h for common helpers)
- Game Play Mechanics & Main Loop: (e.g., in mazeplay.c)

Players can navigate procedurally generated mazes, aiming to reach the exit 'E' while avoiding '#'-walls.
